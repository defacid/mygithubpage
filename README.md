nomdeplu.me is a VERY simple name generator
============

Using a list of 2000 of the most popular first names (Feminine and Masculine) and 1000 of the most common last names in the United States using public data from the Social Security Administration, I created a simple JavaScript web-app that creates MILLIONS of unique first and last name combinations. 

Feel free to make contributions or build your own apps based off of mine. This project was an idea I had months ago but never actually did anything with, so I decided to start building it and finish it in my spare time over the course of the past 3 days.
